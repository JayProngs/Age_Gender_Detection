# age_gender_detection

Prediction model is generated for age and gender using tensorflow which we use it in prediction of age and gender. We use the image from the streaming live feed of webcam to show box around the detected face with predicted age and gender above the box.

Future works includes addition of prediction of emotion in system as well and integrate that with current system.
I hope it will help you.

Thanks and Enjoy coding,
Jayesh
